                        In 2008, Josep Guardiola accepted the difficult job of replacing Frank Rijkaard as coach and end
                        a
                        run
                        of two seasons without a trophy. To do so, he applied the same style of play that was used when
                        he
                        was a
                        player at the Club, an attacking philosophy based on passing and it turned out to be a great
                        success.
                        <br>
                        In his debut season, Guardiola won all three trophies available. After a winning start to the
                        following
                        campaign in 2009/10, Barça became the team of the Six Trophies, all won in the calendar year of
                        2009.
                        The run of success continued with Guardiola claiming 14 titles of a possible 19 as coach in his
                        four
                        seasons in charge. Guardiola became a reference point in football and his Barça side went beyond
                        the
                        strictly footballing field.

                        Under the direction of Josep Guardiola, the team had a dream 12 months, winning every trophy
                        possible.
                        Six titles that they claimed with authority, Barça on the field were untouchable. At the end of
                        the
                        season there were celebrations and the trophies kept coming for the rest of the year.

                        FC Barcelona made history with the nomination of Xavi, Iniesta and Messi as finalists for the
                        FIFA
                        Ballon d'Or 2010. Three Barça players who all came up through La Masia swept the podium.
                        Journalists,
                        coaches and captains from around the world, the elite of world football, lauded Barça’s style.
                        It
                        was
                        the first time that all three finalists came from the youth academy of the same club. It was a
                        full
                        recognition of the work done at La Masia. Three superstars developed at home, instilled with the
                        values
                        of effort, humility, sportsmanship and enthusiasm, were selected as the three best players in
                        the
                        world
                        in 2010.

                        On 28 May 2011 Barça lifted its fourth European Cup. The victory came at the new Wembley
                        Stadium,
                        the
                        same place where in 1992 Cruyff’s Barça had won the trophy for the first time. It was full of
                        symbolism.
                        After winning a very difficult semi-final against Real Madrid, Barça played for the title
                        against
                        Manchester United, who they had defeated in the Rome final two years before. A clearly superior
                        Barça
                        won 3-1 with goals each striker: Pedro, Messi and Villa.
                        <br>
                        It was a great display of football, one of the best ever seen in a Champions League final.
                        Europe
                        hailed
                        Barça, and the world press followed suit. At the end of the summer Barça confirmed its greatness
                        by
                        winning the Spanish Super Cup against Real Madrid and UEFA Super Cup against Porto.

                        One of the saddest pieces of news in Barça history was received on 25 April 2014 when Francesc
                        'Tito'
                        Vilanova i Bayó (Bellcaire d'Empordà, 09/17/1968 - 04/25/2014, Barcelona), a man loved and
                        admired
                        by
                        all, died at the age of 45 after failing to overcome an illness had forced him in July to step
                        away
                        from
                        his duties as head coach of the first team, and just a couple of months after leading the team
                        to a
                        league title with 100 points, a record achievement. Vilanova was also Guardiola's second in

                        from
                        2008 to 2012. A totalof 53,000 people came to Camp Nou in the days after his death to pay him a

                    <p>
                        In the summer of 2014 Barça said goodbye to two captains. Two symbols. Carles Puyol, the eternal
                        captain, announced his retirement as a player after 593 official games and a career that made
                        him an
                        idol for Barça fans. The most memorable of these were his defensive stop using the Barça shield
                        in a
                        Champions League match, his kisses to La Senyera during Barça’s 6–2 rout at the Bernabéu or when
                        he
                        gave
                        Abidal the honour of raising the Cup following the victory at Wembley in 2011. Puyol’s departure
                        coincided with that of Victor Valdés, the long-time Barça goalkeeper who months earlier had
                        announced
                        his intention to leave the team at the end of the 2013/14 season. One of the best ever to wear
                        the
                        blaugrana shirt, Valdés conceded just 441 goals in 535 matches. Among his most outstanding
                        performances
                        was in the 2006 Champions League final in Paris and the semi-final against Chelsea in 2009.

                        Gerardo Martino took over for Tito Vilanova in the summer of 2013 but, despite a good start, the
                        left
                        after the 2013/14 season having only won the Spanish Super Cup. Luis Enrique, a beloved former
                        Barça
                        player, took Martino’s place as coach in the summer of 2014 and success immediately followed. In
                        his
                        first year as coach, Luis Enrique would attain the second treble in Barça history, just six
                        seasons
                        after the first. FC Barcelona won the League, Copa del Rey and Champions League in one magical
                        season.
                        The same team, consisting of top players like Messi, Iniesta, Neymar Jr and Luis Suárez went on
                        to
                        win a
                        total of five titles in 2015, adding the UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup to the treble. To
                        that
                        treble the team would add four more trophies the following season: the European Super Cup, the
                        Club
                        World Cup, the league and the Copa del Rey. Furthermore, in the 2016/17 season, the team won the
                        Copa
                        del Rey, their third in a row.
